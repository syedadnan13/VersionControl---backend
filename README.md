# VersionControl---backend
This backend repo is a custom-built Version Control System (VCS) server that combines Git-like file operations with a full REST API for users, repositories, and issue management. It is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO, and includes a custom CLI that mimics essential Git commands such as init, add, commit, push, pull, and revert.
